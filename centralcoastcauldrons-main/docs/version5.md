# Version 5 - Order Search

This is the final version of your potion shop. You will now add search functionality to your backend that will power the search orders page on https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/.

`carts.py` contains a search endpoint. Do not change the method signature of this endpoint, and ensure that the format of what you return matches the example JSON.

Once you've implemented the search endpoint, make sure you test your work using the search orders page mentioned above. Filtering, paging, and sorting must all work correctly to get full points on this assignment.

As a reference, feel free to look at this lecture where I cover one way of implementing such a search functionality: https://observablehq.com/@calpoly-pierce/python-connectivity#cell-70.
