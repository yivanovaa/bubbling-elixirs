# Version 4 - Develop a Data-Driven Shop Strategy

In this version, we will introduce a competition among all potion shops. Your goal is to develop a **winning strategy** to create the most profitable shop.

## Step 1: Define Your Strategy
Create a markdown file called `strategy.md` and save it in your GitHub repository. In this document, outline your **hypothesis** on what you believe are the **three most important changes** your shop needs to make to maximize profitability. Be specific about why you believe these changes matter.

## Step 2: Design Your Experiments
For each hypothesis, detail a plan for how you would **test** its impact. This likely involves collecting additional data that is not currently tracked. Consider:
- What specific metrics will indicate success?
- How will you measure the effect of changes over time?

## Step 3: Implement Additional Instrumentation
To test your hypotheses effectively, you may need to track new data points. Identify and implement the necessary **analytics and instrumentation** to collect this data. This could include:
- Tracking customer purchasing behavior trends.
- Monitoring potion sales patterns across different days and times.
- Measuring inventory efficiency and waste reduction.

Add a section to your strategy document detailing the new instrumentation you added to your shop to test your hypotheses and why.

## Step 4: Write Analytics Queries
Write the SQL queries that you will use based on the instrumentation you did in step 3 to test your hypotheses.


All four steps should be detailed in your `strategy.md`. I'm not grading based on length but rather quality of thought, but generally you should expect this to be around 3 pages in total of markdown text. Good luck!
