Central Coast Cauldrons is a stubbed-out API designed as a starting point for learning how to build backend services that integrate with a persistence layer. You will progressively develop your own version of the API and integrate it with an increasingly sophisticated database backend. When you register your backend at the [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/), simulated customers will shop at your store using your API.

The application is set in a simulated fantasy RPG world where adventurers seek to buy potions. Your shop is one of many in this world, offering a variety of potions with over 100,000 possible combinations.

## Game Mechanics

You start with 100 gold, an empty inventory, and no barrels. Your backend API is invoked at regular intervals, called 'ticks,' occurring every two hours. There are 12 ticks per day and 7 days in a week. The weekdays in the Potion Exchange world are:

1. Edgeday
2. Bloomday
3. Aracanaday
4. Hearthday
5. Crownday
6. Blesseday
7. Soulday

Three primary actions occur during these ticks:

1. **Customer Interactions**: On each tick, one or more simulated customers access your catalog endpoint to buy potions. The frequency and timing of customer visits vary by the time of day, and each customer has specific potion preferences. Your shop's performance is evaluated and scored based on multiple criteria (more details on [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/)), influencing how often customers visit.

2. **Potion Creation**: Every other tick presents an opportunity to brew new potions. Each potion requires 100 ml of any combination of red, green, blue, or dark liquid. You must have enough of the chosen liquid in your barrelled inventory to brew a potion.

3. **Barrel Purchasing**: Every other tick, you can purchase additional barrels of various colors. Your API receives a catalog of available barrels and must respond with your purchase decisions. The cost of each barrel is deducted from your balance upon purchase.

Managing your gold and inventory levels effectively is crucial. The [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/) maintains an authoritative record of your shop's stats, which you can view.

### Customers

Customers vary in their shopping habits. Some are more likely to shop on certain days or at specific times. Each customer belongs to a class that significantly influences their potion preferences. The amount a customer is willing to spend depends on their wealth level and how closely the potions match their preferences.

Customers are more likely to visit a shop with a good reputation. You can monitor your shop's reputation at [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/). Reputation is based on four factors:

1. **Value**: Competitive pricing compared to other shops.
2. **Quality**: How well your potions match customer preferences.
3. **Reliability**: Avoiding errors such as checkout failures or listing unavailable potions.
4. **Recognition**: The number of successful purchases by a given customer class. Serving more of a class increases their trust in your shop.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your potion shop:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository by copying the files from this. Do not fork!
   - Name your repository something unique.
   - Make your repository private and grant read access to `jackalnom`.

2. **Setup Supabase**
   - Sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Click the "Connect" button at the top of the screen.
   - Copy the connection string for Session Pooler (should be the bottom one) and modify it:
     - Replace `postgres://` with `postgresql+psycopg://`.
     - Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password you just setup.
     - Avoid special characters in the password to prevent parsing issues.
   - Save this connection string for the next step.


3. **Deploy on Render**
   - Sign up at [Render](https://render.com/).
   - Click "New +" and select "Blueprint."
   - Deploy from your new GitHub repository.
   - Choose a unique and creative name for your service.
   - For environment variables, enter:
     - `API_KEY`: A unique string to secure your shop's API. Remember this for later.
     - `POSTGRES_URI`: The connection string you created earlier.
   - Click Deploy!
   - Congratulations you have officially deployed your service to the public cloud! This will be your production instance that is publicly accessible to customers.

4. **Verify Your Deployment**
   - Navigate to `https://[your-project].onrender.com/docs`, replacing `[your-project]` with whatever your project is called. You can find the link on your render dashboard for your particular render project.
   - Click 'Authorize' and enter the same `API_KEY` you put into the environment variables above.
   - Test the available endpoints.

5. **Register Your Shop on Potion Exchange**
   - Sign in to [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/).
   - Add your shop with its base URL and `API_KEY`.

6. **Monitor Performance**
   - Return to [Potion Exchange](https://potion-exchange.vercel.app/) to track your shop's progress.
   - Observe changes in gold balance, potion inventory, and customer interactions.

## Local Development & Testing

To run your server locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**
    - [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - Run:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Setup local database**
   - Install Docker and Docker CLI if you don't already have it.
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     docker run --name mypostgres -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:latest
     ```
    - In the future, you can restart the container by just running:
      ```bash
      docker start mypostgres
      ```
    - Upgrade the database to your latest schema:
      ```bash
      uv run alembic upgrade head
      ```

   - Download and install [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/). Any SQL editor compatible with postgres will work.
   - Create a new connection with the following connection string:
     ```bash
     postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
     ```
   - This will let you query your database and debug issues.


3. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

4. **Test Endpoints**
   - Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
   - Use the interactive documentation to test API endpoints.

5. **Run Tests**
   - Write test cases in the `tests/` folder.
   - Run tests with:
     ```sh
     uv run pytest
     ```
